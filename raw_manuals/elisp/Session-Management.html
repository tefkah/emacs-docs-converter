<span id="index-session-manager"></span>

<p>Emacs supports the X Session Management Protocol, which is used to
suspend and restart applications.  In the X Window System, a program
called the <em>session manager</em> is responsible for keeping track of
the applications that are running.  When the X server shuts down, the
session manager asks applications to save their state, and delays the
actual shutdown until they respond.  An application can also cancel
the shutdown.
</p>
<p>When the session manager restarts a suspended session, it directs
these applications to individually reload their saved state.  It does
this by specifying a special command-line argument that says what
saved session to restore.  For Emacs, this argument is &lsquo;<samp>--smid
<var>session</var></samp>&rsquo;.
</p>

<dd><span id="index-session-file"></span>
<p>Emacs supports saving state via a hook called
<code>emacs-save-session-functions</code>.  Emacs runs this hook when the
session manager tells it that the window system is shutting down.  The
functions are called with no arguments, and with the current buffer
set to a temporary buffer.  Each function can use <code>insert</code> to add
Lisp code to this buffer.  At the end, Emacs saves the buffer in a
file, called the <em>session file</em>.
</p>
<span id="index-emacs_002dsession_002drestore"></span>
<p>Subsequently, when the session manager restarts Emacs, it loads the
session file automatically (see <a href="Loading.html">Loading</a>).  This is performed by a
function named <code>emacs-session-restore</code>, which is called during
startup.  See <a href="Startup-Summary.html">Startup Summary</a>.
</p>
<p>If a function in <code>emacs-save-session-functions</code> returns
non-<code>nil</code>, Emacs tells the session manager to cancel the
shutdown.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Here is an example that just inserts some text into <samp>*scratch*</samp> when
Emacs is restarted by the session manager.
