<span id="index-automatic-face-assignment"></span>
<span id="index-faces_002c-automatic-choice"></span>

<p>This hook is used for automatically assigning faces to text in the
buffer.  It is part of the implementation of Jit-Lock mode, used by
Font-Lock.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-fontification_002dfunctions">Variable: <strong>fontification-functions</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable holds a list of functions that are called by Emacs
redisplay as needed, just before doing redisplay.  They are called even
when Font Lock Mode isn&rsquo;t enabled.  When Font Lock Mode is enabled, this
variable usually holds just one function, <code>jit-lock-function</code>.
</p>
<p>The functions are called in the order listed, with one argument, a
buffer position <var>pos</var>.  Collectively they should attempt to assign
faces to the text in the current buffer starting at <var>pos</var>.
</p>
<p>The functions should record the faces they assign by setting the
<code>face</code> property.  They should also add a non-<code>nil</code>
<code>fontified</code> property to all the text they have assigned faces to.
That property tells redisplay that faces have been assigned to that text
already.
</p>
<p>It is probably a good idea for the functions to do nothing if the
character after <var>pos</var> already has a non-<code>nil</code> <code>fontified</code>
property, but this is not required.  If one function overrides the
assignments made by a previous one, the properties after the last
function finishes are the ones that really matter.
</p>
<p>For efficiency, we recommend writing these functions so that they
usually assign faces to around 400 to 600 characters at each call.
