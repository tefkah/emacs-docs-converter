<span id="Setting-Hooks-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">23.1.2 Setting Hooks</h4>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example that adds a function to a mode hook to turn
on Auto Fill mode when in Lisp Interaction mode:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'auto-fill-mode)
</pre></div>

<p>The value of a hook variable should be a list of functions.  You can
manipulate that list using the normal Lisp facilities, but the modular
way is to use the functions <code>add-hook</code> and <code>remove-hook</code>,
defined below.  They take care to handle some unusual situations and
avoid problems.
</p>
<p>It works to put a <code>lambda</code>-expression function on a hook, but
we recommend avoiding this because it can lead to confusion.  If you
add the same <code>lambda</code>-expression a second time but write it
slightly differently, you will get two equivalent but distinct
functions on the hook.  If you then remove one of them, the other will
still be on it.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-add_002dhook">Function: <strong>add-hook</strong> <em>hook function &amp;optional depth local</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function is the handy way to add function <var>function</var> to hook
variable <var>hook</var>.  You can use it for abnormal hooks as well as for
normal hooks.  <var>function</var> can be any Lisp function that can accept
the proper number of arguments for <var>hook</var>.  For example,
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(add-hook 'text-mode-hook 'my-text-hook-function)
</pre></div>

<p>adds <code>my-text-hook-function</code> to the hook called <code>text-mode-hook</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>function</var> is already present in <var>hook</var> (comparing using
<code>equal</code>), then <code>add-hook</code> does not add it a second time.
</p>
<p>If <var>function</var> has a non-<code>nil</code> property
<code>permanent-local-hook</code>, then <code>kill-all-local-variables</code> (or
changing major modes) won&rsquo;t delete it from the hook variable&rsquo;s local
value.
</p>
<p>For a normal hook, hook functions should be designed so that the order
in which they are executed does not matter.  Any dependence on the order
is asking for trouble.  However, the order is predictable: normally,
<var>function</var> goes at the front of the hook list, so it is executed
first (barring another <code>add-hook</code> call).
</p>
<p>In some cases, it is important to control the relative ordering of functions
on the hook.  The optional argument <var>depth</var> lets you indicate where the
function should be inserted in the list: it should then be a number
between -100 and 100 where the higher the value, the closer to the end of the
list the function should go.  The <var>depth</var> defaults to 0 and for backward
compatibility when <var>depth</var> is a non-nil symbol it is interpreted as a depth
of 90.  Furthermore, when <var>depth</var> is strictly greater than 0 the function
is added <em>after</em> rather than before functions of the same depth.
One should never use a depth of 100 (or -100), because one can never be
sure that no other function will ever need to come before (or after) us.
</p>
<p><code>add-hook</code> can handle the cases where <var>hook</var> is void or its
value is a single function; it sets or changes the value to a list of
functions.
</p>
<p>If <var>local</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that says to add <var>function</var> to the
buffer-local hook list instead of to the global hook list.  This makes
the hook buffer-local and adds <code>t</code> to the buffer-local value.  The
latter acts as a flag to run the hook functions in the default value as
well as in the local value.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-remove_002dhook">Function: <strong>remove-hook</strong> <em>hook function &amp;optional local</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function removes <var>function</var> from the hook variable
<var>hook</var>.  It compares <var>function</var> with elements of <var>hook</var>
using <code>equal</code>, so it works for both symbols and lambda
expressions.
</p>
<p>If <var>local</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, that says to remove <var>function</var>
from the buffer-local hook list instead of from the global hook list.
