<span id="Completion-in-Ordinary-Buffers"></span><h4 class="subsection">20.6.8 Completion in Ordinary Buffers</h4>
<span id="index-inline-completion"></span>

<span id="index-completion_002dat_002dpoint"></span>
<p>Although completion is usually done in the minibuffer, the
completion facility can also be used on the text in ordinary Emacs
buffers.  In many major modes, in-buffer completion is performed by
the <kbd>C-M-i</kbd> or <kbd>M-<span class="key">TAB</span></kbd> command, bound to
<code>completion-at-point</code>.  See <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Symbol-Completion.html#Symbol-Completion">Symbol Completion</a> in <cite>The GNU
Emacs Manual</cite>.  This command uses the abnormal hook variable
<code>completion-at-point-functions</code>:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-completion_002dat_002dpoint_002dfunctions">Variable: <strong>completion-at-point-functions</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The value of this abnormal hook should be a list of functions, which
are used to compute a completion table (see <a href="Basic-Completion.html">Basic Completion</a>) for
completing the text at point.  It can be used by major modes to
provide mode-specific completion tables (see <a href="Major-Mode-Conventions.html">Major Mode Conventions</a>).
</p>
<p>When the command <code>completion-at-point</code> runs, it calls the
functions in the list one by one, without any argument.  Each function
should return <code>nil</code> unless it can and wants to take
responsibility for the completion data for the text at point.
Otherwise it should return a list of the following form:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(<var>start</var> <var>end</var> <var>collection</var> . <var>props</var>)
</pre></div>

<p><var>start</var> and <var>end</var> delimit the text to complete (which should
enclose point).  <var>collection</var> is a completion table for completing
that text, in a form suitable for passing as the second argument to
<code>try-completion</code> (see <a href="Basic-Completion.html">Basic Completion</a>); completion
alternatives will be generated from this completion table in the usual
way, via the completion styles defined in <code>completion-styles</code>
(see <a href="Completion-Variables.html">Completion Variables</a>).  <var>props</var> is a property list for
additional information; any of the properties in
<code>completion-extra-properties</code> are recognized (see <a href="Completion-Variables.html">Completion Variables</a>), as well as the following additional ones:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><code>:predicate</code></dt>
<dd><p>The value should be a predicate that completion candidates need to
satisfy.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>:exclusive</code></dt>
<dd><p>If the value is <code>no</code>, then if the completion table fails to match
the text at point, <code>completion-at-point</code> moves on to the
next function in <code>completion-at-point-functions</code> instead of
reporting a completion failure.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The functions on this hook should generally return quickly, since they
may be called very often (e.g., from <code>post-command-hook</code>).
Supplying a function for <var>collection</var> is strongly recommended if
generating the list of completions is an expensive operation.  Emacs
may internally call functions in <code>completion-at-point-functions</code>
many times, but care about the value of <var>collection</var> for only some
of these calls.  By supplying a function for <var>collection</var>, Emacs
can defer generating completions until necessary.  You can use
<code>completion-table-dynamic</code> to create a wrapper function:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">;; Avoid this pattern.
(let ((beg ...) (end ...) (my-completions (my-make-completions)))
  (list beg end my-completions))

;; Use this instead.
(let ((beg ...) (end ...))
  (list beg
        end
        (completion-table-dynamic
          (lambda (_)
            (my-make-completions)))))
</pre></div>

<p>Additionally, the <var>collection</var> should generally not be
pre-filtered based on the current text between <var>start</var> and
<var>end</var>, because that is the responsibility of the caller of
<code>completion-at-point-functions</code> to do that according to the
completion styles it decides to use.
</p>
<p>A function in <code>completion-at-point-functions</code> may also return a
function instead of a list as described above.  In that case, that
returned function is called, with no argument, and it is entirely
responsible for performing the completion.  We discourage this usage;
it is only intended to help convert old code to using
<code>completion-at-point</code>.
</p>
<p>The first function in <code>completion-at-point-functions</code> to return a
non-<code>nil</code> value is used by <code>completion-at-point</code>.  The
remaining functions are not called.  The exception to this is when
there is an <code>:exclusive</code> specification, as described above.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>The following function provides a convenient way to perform
completion on an arbitrary stretch of text in an Emacs buffer:
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-completion_002din_002dregion">Function: <strong>completion-in-region</strong> <em>start end collection &amp;optional predicate</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function completes the text in the current buffer between the
positions <var>start</var> and <var>end</var>, using <var>collection</var>.  The
argument <var>collection</var> has the same meaning as in
<code>try-completion</code> (see <a href="Basic-Completion.html">Basic Completion</a>).
</p>
<p>This function inserts the completion text directly into the current
buffer.  Unlike <code>completing-read</code> (see <a href="Minibuffer-Completion.html">Minibuffer Completion</a>), it does not activate the minibuffer.
</p>
<p>For this function to work, point must be somewhere between <var>start</var>
and <var>end</var>.
</p></dd></dl>
