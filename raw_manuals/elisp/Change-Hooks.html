<p>These hook variables let you arrange to take notice of changes in
buffers (or in a particular buffer, if you make them buffer-local).
See also <a href="Special-Properties.html">Special Properties</a>, for how to detect changes to
specific parts of the text.
</p>
<p>The functions you use in these hooks should save and restore the match
data if they do anything that uses regular expressions; otherwise, they
will interfere in bizarre ways with the editing operations that call
them.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-before_002dchange_002dfunctions">Variable: <strong>before-change-functions</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable holds a list of functions to call when Emacs is about to
modify a buffer.  Each function gets two arguments, the beginning and
end of the region that is about to change, represented as integers.
The buffer that is about to change is always the current buffer when
the function is called.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-after_002dchange_002dfunctions">Variable: <strong>after-change-functions</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable holds a list of functions to call after Emacs modifies a
buffer.  Each function receives three arguments: the beginning and end
of the region just changed, and the length of the text that existed
before the change.  All three arguments are integers.  The buffer that
has been changed is always the current buffer when the function is
called.
</p>
<p>The length of the old text is the difference between the buffer
positions before and after that text as it was before the change.  As
for the changed text, its length is simply the difference between the
first two arguments.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Output of messages into the <samp>*Messages*</samp> buffer does not call
these functions, and neither do certain internal buffer changes, such
as changes in buffers created by Emacs internally for certain jobs,
that should not be visible to Lisp programs.
</p>
<p>The vast majority of buffer changing primitives will call
<code>before-change-functions</code> and <code>after-change-functions</code> in
balanced pairs, once for each change, where the arguments to these
hooks exactly delimit the change being made.  Yet, hook functions
should not rely on this always being the case, because some complex
primitives call <code>before-change-functions</code> once before making
changes, and then call <code>after-change-functions</code> zero or more
times, depending on how many individual changes the primitive is
making.  When that happens, the arguments to
<code>before-change-functions</code> will enclose a region in which the
individual changes are made, but won&rsquo;t necessarily be the minimal such
region, and the arguments to each successive call of
<code>after-change-functions</code> will then delimit the part of text being
changed exactly.  In general, we advise using either the before- or
the after-change hook, but not both.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-combine_002dafter_002dchange_002dcalls">Macro: <strong>combine-after-change-calls</strong> <em>body&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>The macro executes <var>body</var> normally, but arranges to call the
after-change functions just once for a series of several changes&mdash;if
that seems safe.
</p>
<p>If a program makes several text changes in the same area of the buffer,
using the macro <code>combine-after-change-calls</code> around that part of
the program can make it run considerably faster when after-change hooks
are in use.  When the after-change hooks are ultimately called, the
arguments specify a portion of the buffer including all of the changes
made within the <code>combine-after-change-calls</code> body.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You must not alter the values of
<code>after-change-functions</code> within
the body of a <code>combine-after-change-calls</code> form.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> If the changes you combine occur in widely scattered
parts of the buffer, this will still work, but it is not advisable,
because it may lead to inefficient behavior for some change hook
functions.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-combine_002dchange_002dcalls">Macro: <strong>combine-change-calls</strong> <em>beg end body&hellip;</em></dt>
<dd><p>This executes <var>body</var> normally, except any buffer changes it makes
do not trigger the calls to <code>before-change-functions</code> and
<code>after-change-functions</code>.  Instead there is a single call of each
of these hooks for the region enclosed by <var>beg</var> and <var>end</var>, the
parameters supplied to <code>after-change-functions</code> reflecting the
changes made to the size of the region by <var>body</var>.
</p>
<p>The result of this macro is the result returned by <var>body</var>.
</p>
<p>This macro is useful when a function makes a possibly large number of
repetitive changes to the buffer, and the change hooks would otherwise
take a long time to run, were they to be run for each individual
buffer modification.  Emacs itself uses this macro, for example, in
the commands <code>comment-region</code> and <code>uncomment-region</code>.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You must not alter the values of
<code>before-change-functions</code> or <code>after-change-function</code> within
<var>body</var>.
</p>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> You must not make any buffer changes outside of the
region specified by <var>beg</var> and <var>end</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-first_002dchange_002dhook">Variable: <strong>first-change-hook</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable is a normal hook that is run whenever a buffer is changed
that was previously in the unmodified state.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-inhibit_002dmodification_002dhooks">Variable: <strong>inhibit-modification-hooks</strong></dt>
<dd><p>If this variable is non-<code>nil</code>, all of the change hooks are
disabled; none of them run.  This affects all the hook variables
described above in this section, as well as the hooks attached to
certain special text properties (see <a href="Special-Properties.html">Special Properties</a>) and overlay
properties (see <a href="Overlay-Properties.html">Overlay Properties</a>).
</p>
<p>Also, this variable is bound to non-<code>nil</code> while running those
same hook variables, so that by default modifying the buffer from
a modification hook does not cause other modification hooks to be run.
If you do want modification hooks to be run in a particular piece of
code that is itself run from a modification hook, then rebind locally
<code>inhibit-modification-hooks</code> to <code>nil</code>.  However, doing this
may cause recursive calls to the modification hooks, so be sure to
prepare for that (for example, by binding some variable which tells
your hook to do nothing).
</p>
<p>We recommend that you only bind this variable for modifications that
do not result in lasting changes to buffer text contents (for example
face changes or temporary modifications).  If you need to delay change
hooks during a series of changes (typically for performance reasons),
use <code>combine-change-calls</code> or <code>combine-after-change-calls</code>
instead.
