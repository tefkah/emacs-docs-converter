<p>A <em>datagram</em> connection communicates with individual packets rather
than streams of data.  Each call to <code>process-send</code> sends one
datagram packet (see <a href="Input-to-Processes.html">Input to Processes</a>), and each datagram
received results in one call to the filter function.
</p>
<p>The datagram connection doesn&rsquo;t have to talk with the same remote
peer all the time.  It has a <em>remote peer address</em> which specifies
where to send datagrams to.  Each time an incoming datagram is passed
to the filter function, the peer address is set to the address that
datagram came from; that way, if the filter function sends a datagram,
it will go back to that place.  You can specify the remote peer
address when you create the datagram connection using the
<code>:remote</code> keyword.  You can change it later on by calling
<code>set-process-datagram-address</code>.
