<span id="Receiving-Output-from-Processes"></span><h3 class="section">38.9 Receiving Output from Processes</h3>
<span id="index-process-output"></span>
<span id="index-output-from-processes"></span>

<p>The output that an asynchronous subprocess writes to its standard
output stream is passed to a function called the <em>filter
function</em>.  The default filter function simply inserts the output into
a buffer, which is called the associated buffer of the process
(see <a href="Process-Buffers.html">Process Buffers</a>).  If the process has no buffer then the
default filter discards the output.
</p>
<p>If the subprocess writes to its standard error stream, by default
the error output is also passed to the process filter function.  If
Emacs uses a pseudo-TTY (pty) for communication with the subprocess,
then it is impossible to separate the standard output and standard
error streams of the subprocess, because a pseudo-TTY has only one
output channel.  In that case, if you want to keep the output to those
streams separate, you should redirect one of them to a file&mdash;for
example, by using an appropriate shell command via
<code>start-process-shell-command</code> or a similar function.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could use the <code>:stderr</code> parameter with a
non-<code>nil</code> value in a call to <code>make-process</code>
(see <a href="Asynchronous-Processes.html">make-process</a>) to make the destination
of the error output separate from the standard output; in that case,
Emacs will use pipes for communicating with the subprocess.
</p>
<p>When a subprocess terminates, Emacs reads any pending output,
then stops reading output from that subprocess.  Therefore, if the
subprocess has children that are still live and still producing
output, Emacs won&rsquo;t receive that output.
</p>
<p>Output from a subprocess can arrive only while Emacs is waiting: when
reading terminal input (see the function <code>waiting-for-user-input-p</code>),
in <code>sit-for</code> and <code>sleep-for</code> (see <a href="Waiting.html">Waiting</a>), in
<code>accept-process-output</code> (see <a href="Accepting-Output.html">Accepting Output</a>), and in
functions which send data to processes (see <a href="Input-to-Processes.html">Input to Processes</a>).
This minimizes the problem of timing errors that usually plague parallel
programming.  For example, you can safely create a process and only
then specify its buffer or filter function; no output can arrive
before you finish, if the code in between does not call any primitive
that waits.
</p>

<dt id="index-process_002dadaptive_002dread_002dbuffering">Variable: <strong>process-adaptive-read-buffering</strong></dt>
<dd><p>On some systems, when Emacs reads the output from a subprocess, the
output data is read in very small blocks, potentially resulting in
very poor performance.  This behavior can be remedied to some extent
by setting the variable <code>process-adaptive-read-buffering</code> to a
non-<code>nil</code> value (the default), as it will automatically delay reading
from such processes, thus allowing them to produce more output before
Emacs tries to read it.
