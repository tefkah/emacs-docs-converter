<span id="index-logging-echo_002darea-messages"></span>

<p>Almost all the messages displayed in the echo area are also recorded
in the <samp>*Messages*</samp> buffer so that the user can refer back to
them.  This includes all the messages that are output with
<code>message</code>.  By default, this buffer is read-only and uses the major
mode <code>messages-buffer-mode</code>.  Nothing prevents the user from
killing the <samp>*Messages*</samp> buffer, but the next display of a message
recreates it.  Any Lisp code that needs to access the
<samp>*Messages*</samp> buffer directly and wants to ensure that it exists
should use the function <code>messages-buffer</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-messages_002dbuffer">Function: <strong>messages-buffer</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns the <samp>*Messages*</samp> buffer.  If it does not
exist, it creates it, and switches it to <code>messages-buffer-mode</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-message_002dlog_002dmax">User Option: <strong>message-log-max</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable specifies how many lines to keep in the <samp>*Messages*</samp>
buffer.  The value <code>t</code> means there is no limit on how many lines to
keep.  The value <code>nil</code> disables message logging entirely.  Here&rsquo;s
how to display a message and prevent it from being logged:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(let (message-log-max)
  (message &hellip;))
</pre></div>
</dd></dl>

<p>To make <samp>*Messages*</samp> more convenient for the user, the logging
facility combines successive identical messages.  It also combines
successive related messages for the sake of two cases: question
followed by answer, and a series of progress messages.
</p>
<p>A question followed by an answer has two messages like the
ones produced by <code>y-or-n-p</code>: the first is &lsquo;<samp><var>question</var></samp>&rsquo;,
and the second is &lsquo;<samp><var>question</var>...<var>answer</var></samp>&rsquo;.  The first
message conveys no additional information beyond what&rsquo;s in the second,
so logging the second message discards the first from the log.
</p>
<p>A series of progress messages has successive messages like
those produced by <code>make-progress-reporter</code>.  They have the form
&lsquo;<samp><var>base</var>...<var>how-far</var></samp>&rsquo;, where <var>base</var> is the same each
time, while <var>how-far</var> varies.  Logging each message in the series
discards the previous one, provided they are consecutive.
</p>
<p>The functions <code>make-progress-reporter</code> and <code>y-or-n-p</code>
don&rsquo;t have to do anything special to activate the message log
combination feature.  It operates whenever two consecutive messages
are logged that share a common prefix ending in &lsquo;<samp>...</samp>&rsquo;.
