<span id="index-dynamic-libraries"></span>

<p>A <em>dynamically loaded library</em> is a library that is loaded on
demand, when its facilities are first needed.  Emacs supports such
on-demand loading of support libraries for some of its features.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-dynamic_002dlibrary_002dalist">Variable: <strong>dynamic-library-alist</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This is an alist of dynamic libraries and external library files
implementing them.
</p>
<p>Each element is a list of the form
<code>(<var>library</var>&nbsp;<var>files</var>&hellip;)</code><!-- /@w -->, where the <code>car</code> is
a symbol representing a supported external library, and the rest are
strings giving alternate filenames for that library.
</p>
<p>Emacs tries to load the library from the files in the order they
appear in the list; if none is found, the Emacs session won&rsquo;t have
access to that library, and the features it provides will be
unavailable.
</p>
<p>Image support on some platforms uses this facility.  Here&rsquo;s an example
of setting this variable for supporting images on MS-Windows:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(setq dynamic-library-alist
      '((xpm &quot;libxpm.dll&quot; &quot;xpm4.dll&quot; &quot;libXpm-nox4.dll&quot;)
        (png &quot;libpng12d.dll&quot; &quot;libpng12.dll&quot; &quot;libpng.dll&quot;
             &quot;libpng13d.dll&quot; &quot;libpng13.dll&quot;)
        (jpeg &quot;jpeg62.dll&quot; &quot;libjpeg.dll&quot; &quot;jpeg-62.dll&quot;
              &quot;jpeg.dll&quot;)
        (tiff &quot;libtiff3.dll&quot; &quot;libtiff.dll&quot;)
        (gif &quot;giflib4.dll&quot; &quot;libungif4.dll&quot; &quot;libungif.dll&quot;)
        (svg &quot;librsvg-2-2.dll&quot;)
        (gdk-pixbuf &quot;libgdk_pixbuf-2.0-0.dll&quot;)
        (glib &quot;libglib-2.0-0.dll&quot;)
        (gobject &quot;libgobject-2.0-0.dll&quot;)))
</pre></div>

<p>Note that image types <code>pbm</code> and <code>xbm</code> do not need entries in
this variable because they do not depend on external libraries and are
always available in Emacs.
</p>
<p>Also note that this variable is not meant to be a generic facility for
accessing external libraries; only those already known by Emacs can
be loaded through it.
</p>
<p>This variable is ignored if the given <var>library</var> is statically
linked into Emacs.
</p></dd></dl>
