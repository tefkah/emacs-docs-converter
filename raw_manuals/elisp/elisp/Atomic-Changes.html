<span id="Atomic-Change-Groups"></span><h3 class="section">32.31 Atomic Change Groups</h3>
<span id="index-atomic-changes"></span>

<p>In database terminology, an <em>atomic</em> change is an indivisible
change&mdash;it can succeed entirely or it can fail entirely, but it
cannot partly succeed.  A Lisp program can make a series of changes to
one or several buffers as an <em>atomic change group</em>, meaning that
either the entire series of changes will be installed in their buffers
or, in case of an error, none of them will be.
</p>
<p>To do this for one buffer, the one already current, simply write a
call to <code>atomic-change-group</code> around the code that makes the
changes, like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(atomic-change-group
  (insert foo)
  (delete-region x y))
</pre></div>

<p>If an error (or other nonlocal exit) occurs inside the body of
<code>atomic-change-group</code>, it unmakes all the changes in that buffer
that were during the execution of the body.  This kind of change group
has no effect on any other buffers&mdash;any such changes remain.
</p>
<p>If you need something more sophisticated, such as to make changes in
various buffers constitute one atomic group, you must directly call
lower-level functions that <code>atomic-change-group</code> uses.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-prepare_002dchange_002dgroup">Function: <strong>prepare-change-group</strong> <em>&amp;optional buffer</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function sets up a change group for buffer <var>buffer</var>, which
defaults to the current buffer.  It returns a handle that
represents the change group.  You must use this handle to activate the
change group and subsequently to finish it.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>To use the change group, you must <em>activate</em> it.  You must do
this before making any changes in the text of <var>buffer</var>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-activate_002dchange_002dgroup">Function: <strong>activate-change-group</strong> <em>handle</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function activates the change group that <var>handle</var> designates.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>After you activate the change group, any changes you make in that
buffer become part of it.  Once you have made all the desired changes
in the buffer, you must <em>finish</em> the change group.  There are two
ways to do this: you can either accept (and finalize) all the changes,
or cancel them all.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-accept_002dchange_002dgroup">Function: <strong>accept-change-group</strong> <em>handle</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function accepts all the changes in the change group specified by
<var>handle</var>, making them final.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-cancel_002dchange_002dgroup">Function: <strong>cancel-change-group</strong> <em>handle</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function cancels and undoes all the changes in the change group
specified by <var>handle</var>.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>You can cause some or all of the changes in a change group to be
considered as a single unit for the purposes of the <code>undo</code>
commands (see <a href="Undo.html">Undo</a>) by using <code>undo-amalgamate-change-group</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-undo_002damalgamate_002dchange_002dgroup">Function: <strong>undo-amalgamate-change-group</strong></dt>
<dd><p>Amalgamate all the changes made in the change-group since the state
identified by <var>handle</var>.  This function removes all undo boundaries
between undo records of changes since the state described by
<var>handle</var>.  Usually, <var>handle</var> is the handle returned by
<code>prepare-change-group</code>, in which case all the changes since the
beginning of the change-group are amalgamated into a single undo unit.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Your code should use <code>unwind-protect</code> to make sure the group is
always finished.  The call to <code>activate-change-group</code> should be
inside the <code>unwind-protect</code>, in case the user types <kbd>C-g</kbd>
just after it runs.  (This is one reason why
<code>prepare-change-group</code> and <code>activate-change-group</code> are
separate functions, because normally you would call
<code>prepare-change-group</code> before the start of that
<code>unwind-protect</code>.)  Once you finish the group, don&rsquo;t use the
handle again&mdash;in particular, don&rsquo;t try to finish the same group
twice.
</p>
<p>To make a multibuffer change group, call <code>prepare-change-group</code>
once for each buffer you want to cover, then use <code>nconc</code> to
combine the returned values, like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(nconc (prepare-change-group buffer-1)
       (prepare-change-group buffer-2))
</pre></div>

<p>You can then activate the multibuffer change group with a single call
to <code>activate-change-group</code>, and finish it with a single call to
<code>accept-change-group</code> or <code>cancel-change-group</code>.
</p>
<p>Nested use of several change groups for the same buffer works as you
would expect.  Non-nested use of change groups for the same buffer
will get Emacs confused, so don&rsquo;t let it happen; the first change
group you start for any given buffer should be the last one finished.
