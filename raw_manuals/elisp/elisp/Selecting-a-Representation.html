<span id="Selecting-a-Representation-1"></span><h3 class="section">33.4 Selecting a Representation</h3>

<p>Sometimes it is useful to examine an existing buffer or string as
multibyte when it was unibyte, or vice versa.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-set_002dbuffer_002dmultibyte">Function: <strong>set-buffer-multibyte</strong> <em>multibyte</em></dt>
<dd><p>Set the representation type of the current buffer.  If <var>multibyte</var>
is non-<code>nil</code>, the buffer becomes multibyte.  If <var>multibyte</var>
is <code>nil</code>, the buffer becomes unibyte.
</p>
<p>This function leaves the buffer contents unchanged when viewed as a
sequence of bytes.  As a consequence, it can change the contents
viewed as characters; for instance, a sequence of three bytes which is
treated as one character in multibyte representation will count as
three characters in unibyte representation.  Eight-bit characters
representing raw bytes are an exception.  They are represented by one
byte in a unibyte buffer, but when the buffer is set to multibyte,
they are converted to two-byte sequences, and vice versa.
</p>
<p>This function sets <code>enable-multibyte-characters</code> to record which
representation is in use.  It also adjusts various data in the buffer
(including overlays, text properties and markers) so that they cover the
same text as they did before.
</p>
<p>This function signals an error if the buffer is narrowed, since the
narrowing might have occurred in the middle of multibyte character
sequences.
</p>
<p>This function also signals an error if the buffer is an indirect
buffer.  An indirect buffer always inherits the representation of its
base buffer.

<dl>
<dt id="index-string_002das_002dunibyte">Function: <strong>string-as-unibyte</strong> <em>string</em></dt>
<dd><p>If <var>string</var> is already a unibyte string, this function returns
<var>string</var> itself.  Otherwise, it returns a new string with the same
bytes as <var>string</var>, but treating each byte as a separate character
(so that the value may have more characters than <var>string</var>); as an
exception, each eight-bit character representing a raw byte is
converted into a single byte.  The newly-created string contains no
text properties.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-string_002das_002dmultibyte">Function: <strong>string-as-multibyte</strong> <em>string</em></dt>
<dd><p>If <var>string</var> is a multibyte string, this function returns
<var>string</var> itself.  Otherwise, it returns a new string with the same
bytes as <var>string</var>, but treating each multibyte sequence as one
character.  This means that the value may have fewer characters than
<var>string</var> has.  If a byte sequence in <var>string</var> is invalid as a
multibyte representation of a single character, each byte in the
sequence is treated as a raw 8-bit byte.  The newly-created string
contains no text properties.
