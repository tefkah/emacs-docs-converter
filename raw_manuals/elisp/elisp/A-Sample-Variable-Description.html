<p>A <em>variable</em> is a name that can be <em>bound</em> (or <em>set</em>) to
an object.  The object to which a variable is bound is called a
<em>value</em>; we say also that variable holds that value.
Although nearly all variables can be set by the user, certain
variables exist specifically so that users can change them; these are
called <em>user options</em>.  Ordinary variables and user options are
described using a format like that for functions, except that there
are no arguments.
</p>
<p>Here is a description of the imaginary <code>electric-future-map</code>
variable.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-electric_002dfuture_002dmap">Variable: <strong>electric-future-map</strong></dt>
<dd><p>The value of this variable is a full keymap used by Electric Command
Future mode.  The functions in this map allow you to edit commands you
have not yet thought about executing.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>User option descriptions have the same format, but &lsquo;<samp>Variable</samp>&rsquo;
is replaced by &lsquo;<samp>User Option</samp>&rsquo;.
