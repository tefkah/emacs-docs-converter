<span id="index-modifiers-of-events"></span>
<span id="index-translating-input-events"></span>
<span id="index-event-translation"></span>

<p>Emacs modifies every event it reads according to
<code>extra-keyboard-modifiers</code>, then translates it through
<code>keyboard-translate-table</code> (if applicable), before returning it
from <code>read-event</code>.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-extra_002dkeyboard_002dmodifiers">Variable: <strong>extra-keyboard-modifiers</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable lets Lisp programs &ldquo;press&rdquo; the modifier keys on the
keyboard.  The value is a character.  Only the modifiers of the
character matter.  Each time the user types a keyboard key, it is
altered as if those modifier keys were held down.  For instance, if
you bind <code>extra-keyboard-modifiers</code> to <code>?\C-\M-a</code>, then all
keyboard input characters typed during the scope of the binding will
have the control and meta modifiers applied to them.  The character
<code>?\C-@</code>, equivalent to the integer 0, does not count as a control
character for this purpose, but as a character with no modifiers.
Thus, setting <code>extra-keyboard-modifiers</code> to zero cancels any
modification.
</p>
<p>When using a window system, the program can press any of the
modifier keys in this way.  Otherwise, only the <tt class="key">CTL</tt> and <tt class="key">META</tt>
keys can be virtually pressed.
</p>
<p>Note that this variable applies only to events that really come from
the keyboard, and has no effect on mouse events or any other events.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-keyboard_002dtranslate_002dtable">Variable: <strong>keyboard-translate-table</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This terminal-local variable is the translate table for keyboard
characters.  It lets you reshuffle the keys on the keyboard without
changing any command bindings.  Its value is normally a char-table, or
else <code>nil</code>.  (It can also be a string or vector, but this is
considered obsolete.)
</p>
<p>If <code>keyboard-translate-table</code> is a char-table
(see <a href="Char_002dTables.html">Char-Tables</a>), then each character read from the keyboard is
looked up in this char-table.  If the value found there is
non-<code>nil</code>, then it is used instead of the actual input character.
</p>
<p>Note that this translation is the first thing that happens to a
character after it is read from the terminal.  Record-keeping features
such as <code>recent-keys</code> and dribble files record the characters after
translation.
</p>
<p>Note also that this translation is done before the characters are
supplied to input methods (see <a href="Input-Methods.html">Input Methods</a>).  Use
<code>translation-table-for-input</code> (see <a href="Translation-of-Characters.html">Translation of Characters</a>),
if you want to translate characters after input methods operate.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-keyboard_002dtranslate">Function: <strong>keyboard-translate</strong> <em>from to</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function modifies <code>keyboard-translate-table</code> to translate
character code <var>from</var> into character code <var>to</var>.  It creates
the keyboard translate table if necessary.
</p></dd></dl>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example of using the <code>keyboard-translate-table</code> to
make <kbd>C-x</kbd>, <kbd>C-c</kbd> and <kbd>C-v</kbd> perform the cut, copy and paste
operations:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(keyboard-translate ?\C-x 'control-x)
(keyboard-translate ?\C-c 'control-c)
(keyboard-translate ?\C-v 'control-v)
(global-set-key [control-x] 'kill-region)
(global-set-key [control-c] 'kill-ring-save)
(global-set-key [control-v] 'yank)
</pre></div>

<p>On a graphical terminal that supports extended <acronym>ASCII</acronym> input,
you can still get the standard Emacs meanings of one of those
characters by typing it with the shift key.  That makes it a different
character as far as keyboard translation is concerned, but it has the
same usual meaning.
</p>
<p>See <a href="Translation-Keymaps.html">Translation Keymaps</a>, for mechanisms that translate event sequences
at the level of <code>read-key-sequence</code>.
