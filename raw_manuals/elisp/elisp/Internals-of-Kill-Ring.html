<p>The variable <code>kill-ring</code> holds the kill ring contents, in the
form of a list of strings.  The most recent kill is always at the front
of the list.
</p>
<p>The <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> variable points to a link in the
kill ring list, whose <small>CAR</small> is the text to yank next.  We say it
identifies the front of the ring.  Moving
<code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> to a different link is called
<em>rotating the kill ring</em>.  We call the kill ring a &ldquo;ring&rdquo; because
the functions that move the yank pointer wrap around from the end of the
list to the beginning, or vice-versa.  Rotation of the kill ring is
virtual; it does not change the value of <code>kill-ring</code>.
</p>
<p>Both <code>kill-ring</code> and <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> are Lisp
variables whose values are normally lists.  The word &ldquo;pointer&rdquo; in the
name of the <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> indicates that the variable&rsquo;s
purpose is to identify one element of the list for use by the next yank
command.
</p>
<p>The value of <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code> is always <code>eq</code> to one
of the links in the kill ring list.  The element it identifies is the
<small>CAR</small> of that link.  Kill commands, which change the kill ring, also
set this variable to the value of <code>kill-ring</code>.  The effect is to
rotate the ring so that the newly killed text is at the front.
</p>
<p>Here is a diagram that shows the variable <code>kill-ring-yank-pointer</code>
pointing to the second entry in the kill ring <code>(&quot;some text&quot; &quot;a
different piece of text&quot; &quot;yet older text&quot;)</code>.

front of the ring for yanking.  More precisely, the value is a tail
of the value of <code>kill-ring</code>, and its <small>CAR</small> is the kill string
