<span id="Menus-and-the-Keyboard"></span><h4 class="subsection">22.17.3 Menus and the Keyboard</h4>

<p>When a prefix key ending with a keyboard event (a character or
function key) has a definition that is a menu keymap, the keymap
operates as a keyboard menu; the user specifies the next event by
choosing a menu item with the keyboard.
</p>
<p>Emacs displays the keyboard menu with the map&rsquo;s overall prompt
string, followed by the alternatives (the item strings of the map&rsquo;s
bindings), in the echo area.  If the bindings don&rsquo;t all fit at once,
the user can type <tt class="key">SPC</tt> to see the next line of alternatives.
Successive uses of <tt class="key">SPC</tt> eventually get to the end of the menu and
then cycle around to the beginning.  (The variable
<code>menu-prompt-more-char</code> specifies which character is used for
this; <tt class="key">SPC</tt> is the default.)
</p>
<p>When the user has found the desired alternative from the menu, he or
she should type the corresponding character&mdash;the one whose binding is
that alternative.
</p>

the next line of a menu.  Its initial value is 32, the code
for <tt class="key">SPC</tt>.
