<span id="Creating-an-Asynchronous-Process"></span><h3 class="section">38.4 Creating an Asynchronous Process</h3>
<span id="index-asynchronous-subprocess"></span>

<p>In this section, we describe how to create an <em>asynchronous
process</em>.  After an asynchronous process is created, it runs in
parallel with Emacs, and Emacs can communicate with it using the
functions described in the following sections (see <a href="Input-to-Processes.html">Input to Processes</a>, and see <a href="Output-from-Processes.html">Output from Processes</a>).  Note that process
communication is only partially asynchronous: Emacs sends and receives
data to and from a process only when those functions are called.
</p>
<span id="index-pty_002c-when-to-use-for-subprocess-communications"></span>
<span id="index-pipe_002c-when-to-use-for-subprocess-communications"></span>
<p>An asynchronous process is controlled either via a <em>pty</em>
(pseudo-terminal) or a <em>pipe</em>.  The choice of pty or pipe is made
when creating the process, by default based on the value of the
variable <code>process-connection-type</code> (see below).  If available,
ptys are usually preferable for processes visible to the user, as in
Shell mode, because they allow for job control (<kbd>C-c</kbd>, <kbd>C-z</kbd>,
etc.) between the process and its children, and because interactive
programs treat ptys as terminal devices, whereas pipes don&rsquo;t support
these features.  However, for subprocesses used by Lisp programs for
internal purposes (i.e., no user interaction with the subprocess is
required), where significant amounts of data need to be exchanged
between the subprocess and the Lisp program, it is often better to use
a pipe, because pipes are more efficient.  Also, the total number of
ptys is limited on many systems, and it is good not to waste them
unnecessarily.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-make_002dprocess">Function: <strong>make-process</strong> <em>&amp;rest args</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function is the basic low-level primitive for starting
asynchronous subprocesses.  It returns a process object representing
the subprocess.  Compared to the more high-level <code>start-process</code>,
described below, it takes keyword arguments, is more flexible, and
allows to specify process filters and sentinels in a single call.
</p>
<p>The arguments <var>args</var> are a list of keyword/argument pairs.
Omitting a keyword is always equivalent to specifying it with value
<code>nil</code>.  Here are the meaningful keywords:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>:name <var>name</var></dt>
<dd><p>Use the string <var>name</var> as the process name; if a process with this
name already exists, then <var>name</var> is modified (by appending
&lsquo;<samp>&lt;1&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, etc.) to be unique.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:buffer <var>buffer</var></dt>
<dd><p>Use <var>buffer</var> as the process buffer.  If the value is <code>nil</code>,
the subprocess is not associated with any buffer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:command <var>command</var></dt>
<dd><p>Use <var>command</var> as the command line of the process.  The value
should be a list starting with the program&rsquo;s executable file name,
followed by strings to give to the program as its arguments.  If
the first element of the list is <code>nil</code>, Emacs opens a new
pseudoterminal (pty) and associates its input and output with
<var>buffer</var>, without actually running any program; the rest of the
list elements are ignored in that case.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:coding <var>coding</var></dt>
<dd><p>If <var>coding</var> is a symbol, it specifies the coding system to be
used for both reading and writing of data from and to the
connection.  If <var>coding</var> is a cons cell
<code>(<var>decoding</var>&nbsp;.&nbsp;<var>encoding</var>)</code><!-- /@w -->, then <var>decoding</var>
will be used for reading and <var>encoding</var> for writing.  The coding
system used for encoding the data written to the program is also used
for encoding the command-line arguments (but not the program itself,
whose file name is encoded as any other file name; see <a href="Encoding-and-I_002fO.html">file-name-coding-system</a>).
</p>
<p>If <var>coding</var> is <code>nil</code>, the default rules for finding the
coding system will apply.  See <a href="Default-Coding-Systems.html">Default Coding Systems</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:connection-type <var>type</var></dt>
<dd><p>Initialize the type of device used to communicate with the subprocess.
Possible values are <code>pty</code> to use a pty, <code>pipe</code> to use a
pipe, or <code>nil</code> to use the default derived from the value of the
<code>process-connection-type</code> variable.  This parameter and the value
of <code>process-connection-type</code> are ignored if a non-<code>nil</code>
value is specified for the <code>:stderr</code> parameter; in that case, the
type will always be <code>pipe</code>.  On systems where ptys are not
available (MS-Windows), this parameter is likewise ignored, and pipes
are used unconditionally.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:noquery <var>query-flag</var></dt>
<dd><p>Initialize the process query flag to <var>query-flag</var>.
See <a href="Query-Before-Exit.html">Query Before Exit</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:stop <var>stopped</var></dt>
<dd><p>If provided, <var>stopped</var> must be <code>nil</code>; it is an error to use
any non-<code>nil</code> value.  The <code>:stop</code> key is ignored otherwise
and is retained for compatibility with other process types such as
pipe processes.  Asynchronous subprocesses never start in the stopped
state.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:filter <var>filter</var></dt>
<dd><p>Initialize the process filter to <var>filter</var>.  If not specified, a
default filter will be provided, which can be overridden later.
See <a href="Filter-Functions.html">Filter Functions</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:sentinel <var>sentinel</var></dt>
<dd><p>Initialize the process sentinel to <var>sentinel</var>.  If not specified,
a default sentinel will be used, which can be overridden later.
See <a href="Sentinels.html">Sentinels</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:stderr <var>stderr</var></dt>
<dd><p>Associate <var>stderr</var> with the standard error of the process.  A
non-<code>nil</code> value should be either a buffer or a pipe process
created with <code>make-pipe-process</code>, described below.  If
<var>stderr</var> is <code>nil</code>, standard error is mixed with standard
output, and both are sent to <var>buffer</var> or <var>filter</var>.
</p>
<span id="index-standard-error-process"></span>
<p>If <var>stderr</var> is a buffer, Emacs will create a pipe process, the
<em>standard error process</em>.  This process will have the default
filter (see <a href="Filter-Functions.html">Filter Functions</a>), sentinel (see <a href="Sentinels.html">Sentinels</a>), and
coding systems (see <a href="Default-Coding-Systems.html">Default Coding Systems</a>).  On the other hand,
it will use <var>query-flag</var> as its query-on-exit flag (see <a href="Query-Before-Exit.html">Query Before Exit</a>).  It will be associated with the <var>stderr</var> buffer
(see <a href="Process-Buffers.html">Process Buffers</a>) and send its output (which is the standard
error of the main process) there.
</p>
<p>If <var>stderr</var> is a pipe process, Emacs will use it as standard error
process for the new process.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>:file-handler <var>file-handler</var></dt>
<dd><p>If <var>file-handler</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, then look for a file name
handler for the current buffer&rsquo;s <code>default-directory</code>, and invoke
that file name handler to make the process.  If there is no such
handler, proceed as if <var>file-handler</var> were <code>nil</code>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>The original argument list, modified with the actual connection
information, is available via the <code>process-contact</code> function.
</p>
<p>The current working directory of the subprocess is set to the current
buffer&rsquo;s value of <code>default-directory</code> if that is local (as
determined by <code>unhandled-file-name-directory</code>), or <samp>~</samp>
otherwise.  If you want to run a process in a remote directory, pass
<code>:file-handler t</code> to <code>make-process</code>.  In that case, the
current working directory is the local name component of
<code>default-directory</code> (as determined by <code>file-local-name</code>).
</p>
<p>Depending on the implementation of the file name handler, it might not
be possible to apply <var>filter</var> or <var>sentinel</var> to the resulting
process object.  The <code>:stderr</code> argument cannot be a pipe process,
file name handlers do not support pipe processes for this.  A buffer
as <code>:stderr</code> argument is accepted, its contents is shown without
the use of pipe processes.  See <a href="Filter-Functions.html">Filter Functions</a>, <a href="Sentinels.html">Sentinels</a>,
and <a href="Accepting-Output.html">Accepting Output</a>.
</p>
<p>Some file name handlers may not support <code>make-process</code>.  In such
cases, this function does nothing and returns <code>nil</code>.

<dl>
<dt id="index-start_002dprocess">Function: <strong>start-process</strong> <em>name buffer-or-name program &amp;rest args</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function is a higher-level wrapper around <code>make-process</code>,
exposing an interface that is similar to <code>call-process</code>.  It
creates a new asynchronous subprocess and starts the specified
<var>program</var> running in it.  It returns a process object that stands
for the new subprocess in Lisp.  The argument <var>name</var> specifies the
name for the process object; as with <code>make-process</code>, it is
modified if necessary to make it unique.  The buffer
<var>buffer-or-name</var> is the buffer to associate with the process.
</p>
<p>If <var>program</var> is <code>nil</code>, Emacs opens a new pseudoterminal (pty)
and associates its input and output with <var>buffer-or-name</var>, without
creating a subprocess.  In that case, the remaining arguments
<var>args</var> are ignored.
</p>
<p>The rest of <var>args</var> are strings that specify command line arguments
for the subprocess.
</p>
<p>In the example below, the first process is started and runs (rather,
sleeps) for 100 seconds (the output buffer &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo; is created
immediately).  Meanwhile, the second process is started, and
given the name &lsquo;<samp>my-process&lt;1&gt;</samp>&rsquo; for the sake of uniqueness.  It
inserts the directory listing at the end of the buffer &lsquo;<samp>foo</samp>&rsquo;,
before the first process finishes.  Then it finishes, and a message to
that effect is inserted in the buffer.  Much later, the first process
finishes, and another message is inserted in the buffer for it.

<dt id="index-start_002dfile_002dprocess">Function: <strong>start-file-process</strong> <em>name buffer-or-name program &amp;rest args</em></dt>
<dd><p>Like <code>start-process</code>, this function starts a new asynchronous
subprocess running <var>program</var> in it, and returns its process
object.
</p>
<p>The difference from <code>start-process</code> is that this function may
invoke a file name handler based on the value of <code>default-directory</code>.
This handler ought to run <var>program</var>, perhaps on the local host,
perhaps on a remote host that corresponds to <code>default-directory</code>.
In the latter case, the local part of <code>default-directory</code> becomes
the working directory of the process.
</p>
<p>This function does not try to invoke file name handlers for
<var>program</var> or for the rest of <var>args</var>.  For that reason, if
<var>program</var> or any of <var>args</var> use the remote-file syntax
(see <a href="Magic-File-Names.html">Magic File Names</a>), they must be converted either to file
names relative to <code>default-directory</code>, or to names that identify
the files locally on the remote host, by running them through
<code>file-local-name</code>.
</p>
<p>Depending on the implementation of the file name handler, it might not be
possible to apply <code>process-filter</code> or <code>process-sentinel</code> to
the resulting process object.  See <a href="Filter-Functions.html">Filter Functions</a>, and <a href="Sentinels.html">Sentinels</a>.
</p>
<p>Some file name handlers may not support <code>start-file-process</code> (for
example the function <code>ange-ftp-hook-function</code>).  In such cases,
this function does nothing and returns <code>nil</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-start_002dprocess_002dshell_002dcommand">Function: <strong>start-process-shell-command</strong> <em>name buffer-or-name command</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function is like <code>start-process</code>, except that it uses a
shell to execute the specified <var>command</var>.  The argument
<var>command</var> is a shell command string.  The variable
<code>shell-file-name</code> specifies which shell to use.
</p>
<p>The point of running a program through the shell, rather than directly
with <code>make-process</code> or <code>start-process</code>, is so that you can
employ shell features such as wildcards in the arguments.  It follows
that if you include any arbitrary user-specified arguments in the
command, you should quote them with <code>shell-quote-argument</code> first,
so that any special shell characters do <em>not</em> have their special
shell meanings.  See <a href="Shell-Arguments.html">Shell Arguments</a>.  Of course, when executing
commands based on user input you should also consider the security
implications.

<dt id="index-start_002dfile_002dprocess_002dshell_002dcommand">Function: <strong>start-file-process-shell-command</strong> <em>name buffer-or-name command</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function is like <code>start-process-shell-command</code>, but uses
<code>start-file-process</code> internally.  Because of this, <var>command</var>
can also be executed on remote hosts, depending on <code>default-directory</code>.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-process_002dconnection_002dtype">Variable: <strong>process-connection-type</strong></dt>
<dd><p>This variable controls the type of device used to communicate with
asynchronous subprocesses.  If it is non-<code>nil</code>, then ptys are
used, when available.  Otherwise, pipes are used.
</p>
<p>The value of <code>process-connection-type</code> takes effect when
<code>make-process</code> or <code>start-process</code> is called.  So you can
specify how to communicate with one subprocess by binding the variable
around the call to these functions.
</p>
<p>Note that the value of this variable is ignored when
<code>make-process</code> is called with a non-<code>nil</code> value of the
<code>:stderr</code> parameter; in that case, Emacs will communicate with
the process using pipes.  It is also ignored if ptys are unavailable
(MS-Windows).

<p>To determine whether a given subprocess actually got a pipe or a pty,
use the function <code>process-tty-name</code> (see <a href="Process-Information.html">Process Information</a>).
