<span id="Scanning-Keymaps-1"></span><h3 class="section">22.16 Scanning Keymaps</h3>
<span id="index-scanning-keymaps"></span>
<span id="index-keymaps_002c-scanning"></span>

<p>This section describes functions used to scan all the current keymaps
for the sake of printing help information.
</p>
<dl>
<dt id="index-accessible_002dkeymaps">Function: <strong>accessible-keymaps</strong> <em>keymap &amp;optional prefix</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function returns a list of all the keymaps that can be reached (via
zero or more prefix keys) from <var>keymap</var>.  The value is an
association list with elements of the form <code>(<var>key</var> .
<var>map</var>)</code>, where <var>key</var> is a prefix key whose definition in
<var>keymap</var> is <var>map</var>.
</p>
<p>The elements of the alist are ordered so that the <var>key</var> increases
in length.  The first element is always <code>([] . <var>keymap</var>)</code>,
because the specified keymap is accessible from itself with a prefix of
no events.
</p>
<p>If <var>prefix</var> is given, it should be a prefix key sequence; then
<code>accessible-keymaps</code> includes only the submaps whose prefixes start
with <var>prefix</var>.  These elements look just as they do in the value of
<code>(accessible-keymaps)</code>; the only difference is that some elements
are omitted.
</p>
<p>In the example below, the returned alist indicates that the key
<tt class="key">ESC</tt>, which is displayed as &lsquo;<samp>^[</samp>&rsquo;, is a prefix key whose
definition is the sparse keymap <code>(keymap (83 . center-paragraph)
(115 . foo))</code>.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(accessible-keymaps (current-local-map))
&rArr;(([] keymap
      (27 keymap   ; <span class="roman">Note this keymap for <tt class="key">ESC</tt> is repeated below.</span>
          (83 . center-paragraph)
          (115 . center-line))
      (9 . tab-to-tab-stop))
</pre><pre class="example">

</pre><pre class="example">   (&quot;^[&quot; keymap
    (83 . center-paragraph)
    (115 . foo)))
</pre></div>

<p>In the following example, <kbd>C-h</kbd> is a prefix key that uses a sparse
keymap starting with <code>(keymap (118 . describe-variable)&hellip;)</code>.
Another prefix, <kbd>C-x 4</kbd>, uses a keymap which is also the value of
the variable <code>ctl-x-4-map</code>.  The event <code>mode-line</code> is one of
several dummy events used as prefixes for mouse actions in special parts
of a window.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(accessible-keymaps (current-global-map))
&rArr; (([] keymap [set-mark-command beginning-of-line &hellip;
                   delete-backward-char])
</pre><pre class="example">    (&quot;^H&quot; keymap (118 . describe-variable) &hellip;
     (8 . help-for-help))
</pre><pre class="example">    (&quot;^X&quot; keymap [x-flush-mouse-queue &hellip;
     backward-kill-sentence])
</pre><pre class="example">    (&quot;^[&quot; keymap [mark-sexp backward-sexp &hellip;
     backward-kill-word])
</pre><pre class="example">    (&quot;^X4&quot; keymap (15 . display-buffer) &hellip;)
</pre><pre class="example">    ([mode-line] keymap
     (S-mouse-2 . mouse-split-window-horizontally) &hellip;))
</pre></div>

<p>These are not all the keymaps you would see in actuality.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-map_002dkeymap">Function: <strong>map-keymap</strong> <em>function keymap</em></dt>
<dd><p>The function <code>map-keymap</code> calls <var>function</var> once
for each binding in <var>keymap</var>.  It passes two arguments,
the event type and the value of the binding.  If <var>keymap</var>
has a parent, the parent&rsquo;s bindings are included as well.
This works recursively: if the parent has itself a parent, then the
grandparent&rsquo;s bindings are also included and so on.
</p>
<p>This function is the cleanest way to examine all the bindings
in a keymap.
</p></dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-where_002dis_002dinternal">Function: <strong>where-is-internal</strong> <em>command &amp;optional keymap firstonly noindirect no-remap</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function is a subroutine used by the <code>where-is</code> command
(see <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Help.html#Help">Help</a> in <cite>The GNU Emacs Manual</cite>).  It returns a list
of all key sequences (of any length) that are bound to <var>command</var> in a
set of keymaps.
</p>
<p>The argument <var>command</var> can be any object; it is compared with all
keymap entries using <code>eq</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>keymap</var> is <code>nil</code>, then the maps used are the current active
keymaps, disregarding <code>overriding-local-map</code> (that is, pretending
its value is <code>nil</code>).  If <var>keymap</var> is a keymap, then the
maps searched are <var>keymap</var> and the global keymap.  If <var>keymap</var>
is a list of keymaps, only those keymaps are searched.
</p>
<p>Usually it&rsquo;s best to use <code>overriding-local-map</code> as the expression
for <var>keymap</var>.  Then <code>where-is-internal</code> searches precisely
the keymaps that are active.  To search only the global map, pass the
value <code>(keymap)</code> (an empty keymap) as <var>keymap</var>.
</p>
<p>If <var>firstonly</var> is <code>non-ascii</code>, then the value is a single
vector representing the first key sequence found, rather than a list of
all possible key sequences.  If <var>firstonly</var> is <code>t</code>, then the
value is the first key sequence, except that key sequences consisting
entirely of <acronym>ASCII</acronym> characters (or meta variants of <acronym>ASCII</acronym>
characters) are preferred to all other key sequences and that the
return value can never be a menu binding.
</p>
<p>If <var>noindirect</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, <code>where-is-internal</code> doesn&rsquo;t look
inside menu-items to find their commands.  This makes it possible to search for
a menu-item itself.
</p>
<p>The fifth argument, <var>no-remap</var>, determines how this function
treats command remappings (see <a href="Remapping-Commands.html">Remapping Commands</a>).  There are two
cases of interest:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt>If a command <var>other-command</var> is remapped to <var>command</var>:</dt>
<dd><p>If <var>no-remap</var> is <code>nil</code>, find the bindings for
<var>other-command</var> and treat them as though they are also bindings
for <var>command</var>.  If <var>no-remap</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, include the
vector <code>[remap <var>other-command</var>]</code> in the list of possible key
sequences, instead of finding those bindings.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>If <var>command</var> is remapped to <var>other-command</var>:</dt>
<dd><p>If <var>no-remap</var> is <code>nil</code>, return the bindings for
<var>other-command</var> rather than <var>command</var>.  If <var>no-remap</var> is
non-<code>nil</code>, return the bindings for <var>command</var>, ignoring the
fact that it is remapped.
</p></dd>
</dl>
</dd></dl>

<dl>
<dt id="index-describe_002dbindings">Command: <strong>describe-bindings</strong> <em>&amp;optional prefix buffer-or-name</em></dt>
<dd><p>This function creates a listing of all current key bindings, and
displays it in a buffer named <samp>*Help*</samp>.  The text is grouped by
modes&mdash;minor modes first, then the major mode, then global bindings.
</p>
<p>If <var>prefix</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a prefix key; then the
listing includes only keys that start with <var>prefix</var>.
</p>
<p>When several characters with consecutive <acronym>ASCII</acronym> codes have the
same definition, they are shown together, as
&lsquo;<samp><var>firstchar</var>..<var>lastchar</var></samp>&rsquo;.  In this instance, you need to
know the <acronym>ASCII</acronym> codes to understand which characters this means.
For example, in the default global map, the characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="key">SPC</span>
.. ~</samp>&rsquo; are described by a single line.  <tt class="key">SPC</tt> is <acronym>ASCII</acronym> 32,
<kbd>~</kbd> is <acronym>ASCII</acronym> 126, and the characters between them include all
the normal printing characters, (e.g., letters, digits, punctuation,
etc.); all these characters are bound to <code>self-insert-command</code>.
</p>
<p>If <var>buffer-or-name</var> is non-<code>nil</code>, it should be a buffer or a
buffer name.  Then <code>describe-bindings</code> lists that buffer&rsquo;s bindings,
instead of the current buffer&rsquo;s.
</p></dd></dl>
